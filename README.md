# godot-forums-vanilla-plugins

A repository to hold the custom and modified Vanilla plugins we are using for the Godot developer forums.

Some of the plugins within this repository were downloaded originally from the [Vanilla Forums plugins](https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/browse/plugins) site, while some are custom made for the Godot Developer forums.
